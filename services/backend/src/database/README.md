# Note
This folder is not a part of the nest application. [Source idea.](https://victoronwuzor.medium.com/how-to-setup-sequelize-migration-in-a-nestjs-project-b4aec1f88612)

When nest models being edited, appropriate seeders should be edited too. For table changes (altering, dropping, etc) new migrations should be created.
